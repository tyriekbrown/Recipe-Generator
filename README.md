# Recipe-Generator
Here is a complex API, click on the button and a random food will appear with the recipe to make it.

This simple API grabs information on food recipes, it was fun to generate new options when it comes to cooking/new recipes.
Lessons Learned: Pretty much was just having fun with this API after learning how to request data.
